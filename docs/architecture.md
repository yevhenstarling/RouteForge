# RouteForge architecture and decision log

RouteForge turns a day's parcel orders into courier routes. This file records how the system is put together and why it is built that way.

Decisions are numbered so that code comments and commits can refer to them. Each one says whether it is **in place** or **planned**; [plan.md](plan.md) says which phase builds the planned ones. When a phase makes a new decision or changes an old one, it is recorded here in the same commit.

## System at a glance

Three services and one database:

- **api** accepts orders, handles authentication and puts work on the queue.
- **solver** runs as several identical instances. Each one takes jobs from the queue and computes routes.
- **bot** is a Telegram assistant that places orders through the api.
- **PostgreSQL** holds both the domain data and the job queue.

There is no load balancer and no message broker. A free solver takes the next job from the queue itself.

How a plan is made:

1. An operator asks the api to plan a service date. In one transaction the api inserts the plan and one `plan` job.
2. A solver claims the `plan` job and groups the date's orders into one cluster per courier. In the transaction that completes that job, it inserts one `route` job per cluster.
3. Solvers claim the `route` jobs. Each one optimizes the stop order for a single courier and writes the route in the transaction that completes its job.
4. When the last `route` job completes, the plan is marked done.

## Crates

The workspace has exactly five crates, as the [approved description](description.md) requires.

| Crate | Role | Workspace crates it may use |
|---|---|---|
| `routeforge-tsp` | Clustering and route optimization. Pure computation. | none |
| `routeforge-domain` | Domain types, DTOs and geo helpers. With the `db` feature: persistence and the job queue. | none |
| `routeforge-api` | HTTP API, auth, OpenAPI, the map page. | `domain` with `db` |
| `routeforge-solver` | Queue worker. | `domain` with `db`, `tsp` |
| `routeforge-bot` | Telegram bot. | `domain` without `db` |

## Decisions

### D1. One order is one stop, relative to a depot (planned)

An order is either a delivery from the depot to a client or a pickup from a client back to the depot. Couriers start and end at the depot.

Why: this is the capacitated vehicle routing problem, which the approved algorithms solve directly. The alternative, point-to-point orders with their own pickup and drop-off address, needs "pickup before drop-off" ordering that sweep clustering and plain 2-opt do not respect.

### D2. A plan is one `plan` job that fans out into `route` jobs (planned)

Why: optimizing one courier's route is the expensive part, and the routes of a plan are independent of each other. With one job per route, adding solver instances shortens a plan. With one job per whole plan, extra instances would help only when several plans were queued.

Cost: the plan must be marked done exactly once when its last route job finishes, including when two finish at the same moment. A counter on the plan row, incremented in each completing transaction, serializes them.

### D3. Persistence lives in `routeforge-domain`, behind the `db` feature (in place)

Why: both `api` and `solver` need the repositories and the queue, and the workspace is fixed at five crates, so there is no room for a separate storage crate. The feature keeps sqlx out of the bot, which reaches the system only over HTTP. CI builds the bot on its own to prove that.

### D4. Costs are integer metres (planned)

The distance matrix holds `u32` metres.

Why: the change in tour length caused by a move is then exact. Local search cannot keep "improving" by floating-point noise, and tests can assert that the incrementally tracked cost equals the recomputed one.

### D5. The search is deterministic; a deadline only cuts it short (planned)

All randomness comes from a seeded ChaCha8 generator. Annealing cools by iteration count, in fixed-length epochs with reheats. The deadline and the cancel flag stop the search; they never steer it.

Why: the description promises both "works until its deadline" and "deterministic given a seed", and a search steered by the clock cannot be reproduced. With this design the same seed and the same iteration budget give the same route, and a run limited by a deadline returns a prefix of that same search. Tests use iteration budgets.

In place already: the workspace manifest compiles `rand` without OS entropy, so unseeded randomness is not available to `routeforge-tsp` by accident.

### D6. Jobs are delivered at least once; completion is fenced (planned)

A worker holds a job under a lease and renews it with a heartbeat. If the worker dies, the lease expires and another worker takes the job. Results are written in the same transaction that marks the job done, and only if the worker still holds the lease.

Why: with a lease, a slow worker and its replacement can both finish the same job. Fenced completion turns the second one into a no-op, so results are stored once. Lease times are computed with the database clock, so clock differences between workers do not matter.

### D7. Capacity, first version: all demands on a route share the limit (planned)

A route is feasible when the sum of its demands, pickups and deliveries together, is within the courier's capacity.

Why: it never overloads a courier and needs no knowledge of the stop order. It is stricter than necessary, because a courier who delivers before picking up could carry more in total. Tracking the real load along the route is planned for Phase 8.

### D8. The demo works without the internet (planned)

Distances default to Haversine. The Leaflet library is vendored into the repository. Map tiles are optional: without them the routes still draw. The bot idles when its tokens are missing.

### D9. The bot has no authority of its own (planned)

The bot calls the api with a short-lived token of the Telegram user it is talking to. Actions with side effects are confirmed with a button, and the confirmation is handled in code.

Why: whatever the language model decides, the api applies that user's role, so the model cannot do more than the user could. The confirmation step keeps a misread message from creating or cancelling anything.

### D10. Rust 1.99.0, pinned (in place)

`rust-toolchain.toml` pins the compiler for developers, CI and the Docker image.

Why: sqlx 0.9 needs Rust 1.94 or newer, and one compiler everywhere removes differences between machines.

Check before raising the pin: teloxide 0.17 depends, through `aquamarine`, on `proc-macro-error2` 2.0.1. Rust 1.99 compiles it with a future-incompatibility warning (rust-lang/rust#127909), and a later compiler will reject it. The crate is also marked unmaintained (RUSTSEC-2026-0173).

### D11. PostgreSQL 17 (in place)

Why: the queue needs `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` and `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, which 17 has, and nothing in the design needs a newer server. Identifiers will be UUIDv7 generated in the application, so the schema does not depend on a server-side generator.

### D12. One TLS stack, no native crypto libraries (in place)

- Outgoing HTTP uses reqwest 0.12 with rustls and ring. reqwest 0.13 exists, but teloxide 0.17 is built on 0.12, and mixing the two would put two HTTP stacks and two crypto libraries into the bot.
- JWT handling uses the pure-Rust backend of jsonwebtoken.
- sqlx is built without TLS, because Postgres is reached only on localhost or the compose network.
- actix-web is built with only its `macros` feature.

Why: the build needs no OpenSSL, CMake or NASM, on Windows or in the Docker image.

Side effect: the pure-Rust jsonwebtoken backend compiles in the `rsa` crate, which has an open advisory with no fixed release (RUSTSEC-2023-0071, a timing side channel in RSA private-key operations). RouteForge uses HS256 tokens and never performs an RSA operation, so the advisory is ignored in `.cargo/audit.toml` with that reason. The ignore must be removed if tokens ever move to an RSA algorithm.

### D13. Lint baseline (in place)

`unsafe` is forbidden in every crate. `unwrap()` is rejected outside tests, as are `dbg!` and `todo!`. CI runs clippy with warnings as errors.
